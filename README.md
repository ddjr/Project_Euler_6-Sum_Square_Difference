# Project_Euler_6-Sum_Square_Difference

This Project was done as part of https://projecteuler.net/ problem sets. This code solves problem 6. The following discription is taken from https://projecteuler.net/problem=6:

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

To run the project open your terminal, find the directory where this file is located, and type python sum_square_difference.py
